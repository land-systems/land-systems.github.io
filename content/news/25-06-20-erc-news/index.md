Good news!, [Patrick Meyfroidt](https://landsystems-lab.earth/author/patrick-meyfroidt/) has obtained a new grant, from the [European Union ERC AdG](https://erc.europa.eu/news-events/news/erc-2024-advanced-grants-results) scheme, to study the interlinkages between land use and sustainability, and the multiple forms of democratic backsliding. 

You may find a [preprint that argues about the importance of these interlinkages here](https://doi.org/10.31223/X57J1G), hoping that this may generate more conversations and research on this topic.

Stay tuned as several PhDs and Postdoc positions will hopefully circulate soon!
