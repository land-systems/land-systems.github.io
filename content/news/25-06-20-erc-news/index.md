Good news!, [Patrick Meyfroidt](https://landsystems-lab.earth/author/patrick-meyfroidt/) has obtained a new grant, from the [European Union ERC AdG](https://erc.europa.eu/news-events/news/erc-2024-advanced-grants-results) scheme, to study the interlinkages between land use and sustainability, and the multiple forms of democratic backsliding. 

You may find a [preprint that argues about the importance of these interlinkages here](https://doi.org/10.31223/X57J1G), hoping that this may generate more conversations and research on this topic.

Stay tuned as several PhDs and Postdoc positions will hopefully circulate soon! 

This will be the third active ERC in our broader teams at UCLouvain working on land systems, with the project LUIRET led by Eric Lambin about land use impacts of renewable energy transition, and the project DOMESTIC led by Erasmus zu Ermgassen!
