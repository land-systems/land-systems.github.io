Unilateral value chain policies have recently emerged as a key strategy of international land use governance. These policies are part of a broader trend towards trade-based environmental policies, from corporate due diligence to sustainability certification and trade moratoria, that has been critiqued for reinforcing inequities in global trade.

To help assessing and addressing these equity risks, [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2025.103469) develops a framework for monitoring equity across scales and phases of the policy process. This framework includes an equity checklist and agenda for monitoring progress, adaptable to a wide range of unilateral and trade-based policies.

The framework is then applied to the EU Deforestation-free Regulation (EUDR), which aims to stop EU imports of commodities linked to deforestation. EUDR policy references equity as a desired outcome, but as a unilateral policy, it excludes affected actors from formal decision in the design process, and poses further equity risks. We suggest that opportunities for the EUDR to improve equity include embedding non-EU stakeholders in international decision-making processes, enhanced and equitable partnerships with producing countries and major investments in farmer support.
