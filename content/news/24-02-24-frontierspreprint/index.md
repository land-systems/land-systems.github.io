We synthesize concepts and theories explaining resource and land-use frontiers, propose a theory of frontier emergence, and discuss five implications for the governance of frontiers for sustainability. We focus on agriculture and deforestation frontiers in the tropics, but our work can be inspirational for other frontier processes including for extractive resources, such as minerals, or conservation and restoration frontiers.
