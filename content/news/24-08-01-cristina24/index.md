It is great to be able to share our just published study on the [impacts of large-scale forestry investments on neighboring small-scale agriculture in northern Mozambique](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2024.107251), under [Cristina](https://landsystems-lab.earth/author/christina-chiarella)'s leadership.

([Author's free access version here](https://authors.elsevier.com/sd/article/S0264-8377(24)00204-7))  

We build on the EO forestry plantations dataset developed byÂ [Adia](https://landsystems-lab.earth/author/adia-bey), linking with household surveys using a difference-in-difference approach.

We find that households exposed to forestry plantations after 2007 increased their planted areas but did not change hired farm employment, which was accompanied by a decrease in crop yields. Forestry investments also motivated a shift of economic activities, where the local population was less likely to be employed as salaried workers, more likely to be self-employed, and less likely to work in agriculture, which could either mean a shift toward employment in the nonfarm sector, unemployment or inactivity.
