This is a joint effort from the MIDLAND team with colleagues at [Humboldt University in Berlin](https://pages.cms.hu-berlin.de/biogeo/website/) and elsewhere. 
In it, we first synthesize concepts and theories explaining land-use frontiers.

We then propose a middle-range theory of how frontiers emerge, which identifies exogenous pushes, legacies of past waves and actors' anticipations as key mechanisms by which frontiers emerge. Processes of differential rent creation and capture and the built-up of agglomeration economies then constitute key mechanisms sustaining active frontiers.

We then discuss five implications for the governance of frontiers for sustainability:

First, frontiers do not emerge in a vacuum. Land-use frontiers almost always unfold on land that is already claimed, occupied, used, managed or transformed by people, or already provide benefits.
