Our synthesis on resource and land-use frontiers theories is now published !:
[https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.240295](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.240295)

This is a joint effort from the MIDLAND team with colleagues at [Humboldt University in Berlin](https://pages.cms.hu-berlin.de/biogeo/website/) and elsewhere. 
In it, we first synthesize concepts and theories explaining land-use frontiers.

We then propose a middle-range theory of how frontiers emerge, which identifies exogenous pushes, legacies of past waves and actors' anticipations as key mechanisms by which frontiers emerge. Processes of differential rent creation and capture and the built-up of agglomeration economies then constitute key mechanisms sustaining active frontiers.
