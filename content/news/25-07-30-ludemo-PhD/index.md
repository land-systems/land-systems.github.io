The Land Systems for Sustainability Lab from Earth and Life Institute at UCLouvain in Belgium seeks highly qualified & motivated candidates for

Three PhD researcher positions, on 'Land use, Sustainability, and Democratic Backsliding'
 
This offer is also published on Euraxess: [https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/jobs/365449](https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/jobs/365449)

Researchers will contribute to the ERC Advanced Grant project LUDEMO on 'Land use, Sustainability, and Democratic Backsliding' led by Prof. Patrick Meyfroidt.

The general objective of the project is to understand how societies can address sustainability issues in a context where democracy is backsliding, taking land use and land systems as a focal case of interface between sustainability and democratic backsliding. [Here is a preprint](https://doi.org/10.31223/X57J1G) discussing the scientific issues that justify the project. We will work through cross-country studies as well as three focal cases in Europe, Canada's Northern frontiers, and Mozambique.

Research and job description: Within the project, the three PhD researchers will work on mapping and understanding the two-ways interactions between land use, sustainability, and democratic
backsliding, each one working on one of the three focal cases. The work will include: 
- Mapping land use changes linked to democratic backsliding and the associated sustainability impacts, using Earth Observation approaches and other geospatial data
- Mapping indicators of democratic backsliding
- Making spatial statistical analyses of the impacts of democratic backsliding on land use change and of the impacts of land use change on democratic backsliding
- Investigating these issues in focused cases through fieldwork including qualitative and quantitative data collection
- Working in close collaboration with the Postdoctoral researchers tasked with other parts of the project (cross-country and comparative analyses; understanding discourses and representations; and co-developing solutions)

Profiles required: A researcher holding a Master degree in geography, natural sciences, economics, business, data science, or social sciences, with a background in sustainability issues, land use, geospatial and statistical data analysis, impact evaluation, rural development, or related. 

Several skills can constitute strong assets for these positions: 
- Knowledge of and experience with one of the specific contexts, either (i) a context in Europe with democratic backsliding trends; (ii) The Northwestern part of Canada (British Columbia, Alberta, Northwest Territories, Yukon); (iii) Mozambique. Please specify for which context you apply.
- Knowledge of the language in that context.
- Outreach: the project will require engagement with key stakeholders in these contexts.
- Earth Observation, spatial analyses and GIS.
- Data processing and programming skills such as in R or Python.
- Statistical analyses, in particular spatial statistics and impact evaluation methods.
- Social sciences bases, in particular related to the topics of the project

For all positions, the candidate should demonstrate a solid command of the English language, and the ability to work collaboratively in a research team and to establish a local and international networks. 

Contracts will be based on Belgian regulations, depending on prior research experience, and will include the benefits of the Belgian social security such as health insurance. The positions will be under tax-exempted scholarships renewed yearly, with a duration of 4 years to achieve the PhD. 

You do not need to be a Belgian- or EU citizen, nor have a work/residence permit in order to apply for these positions. Your visa costs will be sponsored. We value diversity, inclusivity and creativity and we encourage applicants from diverse backgrounds to apply. 
Candidates should submit a CV and a cover letter detailing qualifications and research interests, to which position you apply, and names and contacts information of one referee to:

The review of applications will start on September 5, 2025, applications will close on that date.
Starting date: As soon as possible.
