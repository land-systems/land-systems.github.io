Yesterday, for Earth Day, was the official launch of the Belgian [Climate and Environment Risk Assessment Center (CERAC)](https://www.cerac.be/), independent center embedded in the Federal administration of climate and environment, and tasked to evaluate climate and environment risks for Belgium and advise policymakers on strategies for increased resilience and adaptation.
