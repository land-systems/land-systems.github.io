Valentin and CÃ©cile, aka the "cocoa team", participated to the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) conference / World Cocoa Foundation 2024 partnership meeting in Amsterdam this week!
They engaged with many actors and shared our work done in collaboration and contributing to the Trase initiative and the SUSTAIN-COCOA project.
