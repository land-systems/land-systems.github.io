Michelle Picoli is a Statistician with a MSc in Remote Sensing at Brazilâ€™s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) and a PhD in Agricultural Engineering at the University of Campinas, Brazil.  Her research focuses on land use mapping and monitoring, statistical analysis of spatio-temporal data and big earth observation data to address challenges related to land use change and environmental impacts.
In the MIDLAND project, Michelle focuses on remote sensing mapping of field size dynamics and mapping smallholder versus large-scale cropland dynamics in Northern Mozambique. Her work provide data about rates and spatial patterns of dynamics linked to farm and field size.
Michelle also contributes to the LULCC Impact of the Sorghum and Millet Upscaling Project in Mali, project on impact assessment of food crop intensification program on tree cover in Sikasso region, Mali.
