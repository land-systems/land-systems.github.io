Eduardo has a background in geography, strategic management and strategic spatial planning. He holds a PhD in spatial sciences from The University of Groningen, The Netherlands (2016). Before joining the MIDLAND team, Eduardo was a postdoctoral researcher at the Land Change Science research unit of the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL in Switzerland. At WSL he did research on the territorial governance arrangements influencing processes of strategic spatial plan-making and plan-implementation at the urban regional level. He also did various systematic literature reviews of the digital transformation and landscape research and the topic of land degradation in strategic spatial planning.

In the MIDLAND project, Eduardo focuses on the governance of land and food systems and their sustainability in emerging land use frontiers, with a specific focus on northern Mozambique. His work will contribute to understanding the effectiveness of a trans-scalar strategic land use planning process by bringing together public and private actors, which are actors living and developing their activities far from the focal area and those actors living in and around the area influencing the governance and resilience of land systems.
