Thais is a postdoctoral researcher at the Earth & Life Institute, UCLouvain. She holds a BSc (2017) and MSc (2020) in Statistics, as well as a PhD (2024) in Data Science from University College Dublin, Ireland.
Her PhD research focused on entity matching, demonstrating that incorporating group information available in the data significantly improves the quality of the final matches. Thais is now applying her expertise in entity matching to the Trase initiative, aiming to enhance the traceability of the Brazilian meat supply chain and contribute to efforts to reduce deforestation linked to the meat industry.
