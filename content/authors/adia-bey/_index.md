Adia Bey is a geospatial analyst with a background in forest monitoring, cultural heritage mapping and the use of GIS to support humanitarian relief work. After earning a BA in Anthropology at Columbia University and a MSc in Environmental Change and Management at Oxford University, Adia has worked on projects in over 20 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America with indigenous communities, NGOs, national governments and UN agencies.

Adia did her doctoral research with the MIDLAND project over 2016-2021. Her research aims are to map 30-years of land use change in northern Mozambique; to draw upon the interdisciplinary research of the MIDLANDS team to identify agent-specific pathways of land use change; and to measure the impacts of these land use changes on food security and carbon stocks.
