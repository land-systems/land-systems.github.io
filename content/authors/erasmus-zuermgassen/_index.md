Erasmus is Assistant Professor in Geography at the Earth & Life Institute, UCLouvain. He holds degrees in Veterinary Science (VetMB, 2013), Food Security (MRes, 2014) and a PhD (2018) on sustainable livestock from the University of Cambridge, UK.

Erasmus' research blends methods from land system science, geography, industrial ecology, economics, and citizen science to map the supply chains which connect agricultural producers with urban consumers around the world. He is a senior researcher in the Trase initiative and co-founder of 'do Pasto ao Prato', a citizen science project and consumer-facing app which reveals the origin and impact of beef products sold in supermarkets across Brazil. His research is funded by [NICFI](https://www.nicfi.no/), [CIFF](https://ciff.org/), and the [ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/homepage). 

Erasmus teaches courses on [Statistics in Geography](https://uclouvain.be/en-cours-2024-lgeo1341) and [Sustainable Urban Spaces](https://uclouvain.be/cours-2023-LGEO2210).
