          <p>Our research focuses on how land use and, more broadly, land systems can contribute to sustainability.</p>
          <p>We study land use transitions, i.e. non-linear land use dynamics at a broad scale, such as forest transitions and emergence of land use frontiers; linkages between globalization and land use, including how supply chain transparency and interventions can halt deforestation; theories of land system change; and social-ecological feedbacks.</p>
          <p>We are part of the Earth and Life Institute at UCLouvain in Belgium.</p>
