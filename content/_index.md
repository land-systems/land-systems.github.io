      title: Land Systems for Sustainability Lab
      body: |
        ![Land Systems](/media/chiarella2021.jpg)

        Our research focuses on how land use and, more broadly, land systems can contribute to sustainability.

        We study land use transitions, i.e. non-linear land use dynamics at a broad scale, such as forest transitions and emergence of land use frontiers; linkages between globalization and land use, including how supply chain transparency and interventions can halt deforestation; theories of land system change; and social-ecological feedbacks.

        We are part of the Earth and Life Institute at UCLouvain in Belgium.
