abstract: As the applications of Earth system models (ESMs) move from general climate
  projections toward questions of mitigation and adaptation, the inclusion of land
  management practices in these models becomes crucial. We carried out a survey among
  modeling groups to show an evolution from models able only to deal with land-cover
  change to more sophisticated approaches that allow also for the partial integration
  of land management changes. For the longer term a comprehensive land management
  representation can be anticipated for all major models. To guide the prioritization
  of implementation, we evaluate ten land management practices-forestry harvest, tree
  species selection, grazing and mowing harvest, crop harvest, crop species selection,
  irrigation, wetland drainage, fertilization, tillage, and fire-for (1) their importance
  on the Earth system, (2) the possibility of implementing them in state-of-the-art
  ESMs, and (3) availability of required input data. Matching these criteria, we identify
  &quot;low-hanging fruits&quot; for the inclusion in ESMs, such as basic implementations
  of crop and forestry harvest and fertilization. We also identify research requirements
  for specific communities to address the remaining land management practices. Data
  availability severely hampers modeling the most extensive land management practice,
  grazing and mowing harvest, and is a limiting factor for a comprehensive implementation
  of most other practices. Inadequate process understanding hampers even a basic assessment
  of crop species selection and tillage effects. The need for multiple advanced model
  structures will be the challenge for a comprehensive implementation of most practices
  but considerable synergy can be gained using the same structures for different practices.
  A continuous and closer collaboration of the modeling, Earth observation, and land
  system science communities is thus required to achieve the inclusion of land management
  in ESMs.
