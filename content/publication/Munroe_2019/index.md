abstract: The increasing global interconnectivity influencing land system changebringswith
  it newchallengesforland-system science.We evaluate whether recentland-system science
  (LSS) research into telecoupling provides a basis to set normative goals or priorities
  for addressing sustainability in coupled human-natural systems. We summarize the
  challenges for sustainability in an increasingly telecoupled world, particularly
  the coordination of multisited, multiscalar networks of public and private sector
  actors. Transnational flows of capital, commodities, energy, people, and waste often
  span multiple territorial jurisdictions. Thus, effective governance of such systems
  requires attention to collective decision-making and negotiation among governments,
  firms, land users, consumers, financial actors, and others
