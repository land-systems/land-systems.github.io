abstract: 'We test an emerging theory of the forest transition using the case of Vietnam.
  In the early 1990s, decollectivisation of agriculture, allocation of forestry land
  to households, and the development of market networks transformed land use in the
  mountains of Vietnam, leading to an increase in forest area. We used census and
  geographic data covering the whole country at a fine level of aggregation to build
  a spatial lag regression model of reforestation. We separated natural forest regrowth
  from the increase in plantation forests. The forest transition theory distinguishes
  between the forest scarcity and economic development paths. Our study suggests that
  the forest scarcity path was in part at work in Vietnam: new policies allocating
  forestry land to households, local scarcity of forest products, and development
  of remote demand for timber contributed to forest cover increases. The evidence
  regarding the economic development path are more ambiguous, as there was no depopulation
  or agricultural decline in marginal regions. We propose a third forest transition
  path that better corresponds to Vietnam&#x27;s situation: a smallholder agricultural
  intensification path. In marginal regions, land scarcity associated with population
  growth, land degradation, and political restrictions led to, on one hand, a decline
  in cultivation on hillsides followed by reforestation and, on the other hand, an
  increase in labour inputs on the plots with the highest agro-ecological potential.
  The development of markets for agricultural inputs and outputs did also contribute
  to reforestation by raising agricultural productivity in mountain paddies and maize
  fields. This reinforced the concentration of agriculture on the most suitable land.
