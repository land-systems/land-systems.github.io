abstract: 'Understanding land use transitions requires analyzing how, when facing
  qualitative environmental change, human agents may modify their beliefs, values,
  and decision rules. This article first reviews some of the useful theories analyzing
  how environmental change can have a feedback effect on behaviors, via the environmental
  cognitions. Then, it discusses three propositions for more cognitively realistic
  agents in land change science: (i) land use choices result from multiple decision-making
  processes and rely on various motives, influenced by social norms, emotions, beliefs,
  and values toward the environment; (ii) social–ecological feedbacks are mediated
  by the environmental cognitions, that is, the perception, interpretation, evaluation
  of environmental change, and decision-making; (iii) human agents actively re-evaluate
  their beliefs, values, and functioning to adapt to unexpected environmental changes.
  Empirical and modeling studies in land change science can progress by linking the
  three components of the feedback loop, that is, environmental changes, environmental
  cognitions, and land use practices.'
