abstract: Shortfalls in global food production, coupled with the growing visibility
  of climate change&#x27;s disruptive effects, have underlined for many observers
  the importance of devoting rural lands to their &#x27;optimal&#x27; use, where they
  can make maximal contributions to the global imperatives of feeding the human population
  and maintaining vital environmental services. In this context observers have endorsed
  rural land use planning as a way to insure that, at least in theory, lands get devoted
  to their best uses. In practice, land use planning in the developing world has resembled
  &#x27;organized anarchy&#x27;. Small landholders with insecure land tenure, overseas
  investors seeking large land deals, NGOs representing indigenous peoples, government
  officials, and staff from international environmental NGOs and multilateral organizations
  have come together in strategic action fields to struggle over and sometimes negotiate
  land use plans for contested landscapes. These plans represent a strategic, spatially
  explicit response to the climate change-biodiversity-food security crisis. Â© 2013
