abstract: Science should provide solutions for societal transformations toward sustainability
  in the face of global environmental change. Land system science, as a systemic science
  focused on complex socio-ecological interactions around land use and associated
  trade-offs and synergies, is well placed to contribute to this agenda. This goal
  requires a stronger engagement with the normative implications of scientific practice,
  research topics, questions and results. We identify concerns as well as three concrete
  steps for land system science to more deeply contribute in normative issues. In
  particular, we encourage land system scientists to discuss explicitly the normative
  questions, values, perspectives and assumptions already present in our research,
  as well as to identify key normative research questions to contribute to societal
  transformations
