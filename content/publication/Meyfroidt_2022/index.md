abstract: 'Land use is central to addressing sustainability issues, including biodiversity
  conservation, climate change, food security, poverty alleviation, and sustainable
  energy. In this paper, we synthesize knowledge accumulated in land system science,
  the integrated study of terrestrial social-ecological systems, into 10 hard truths
  that have strong, general, empirical support. These facts help to explain the challenges
  of achieving sustainability in land use and thus also point toward solutions. The
  10 facts are as follows: 1) Meanings and values of land are socially constructed
  and contested; 2) land systems exhibit complex behaviors with abrupt, hard-to-predict
  changes; 3) irreversible changes and path dependence are common features of land
  systems; 4) some land uses have a small footprint but very large impacts; 5) drivers
  and impacts of land-use change are globally interconnected and spill over to distant
  locations; 6) humanity lives on a used planet where all land provides benefits to
  societies; 7) land-use change usually entails trade-offs between different benefits—&quot;win–wins&quot;
  are thus rare; 8) land tenure and land-use claims are often unclear, overlapping,
  and contested; 9) the benefits and burdens from land are unequally distributed;
  and 10) land users have multiple, sometimes conflicting, ideas of what social and
  environmental justice entails. The facts have implications for governance, but do
  not provide fixed answers. Instead they constitute a set of core principles which
  can guide scientists, policy makers, and practitioners toward meeting sustainability
  challenges in land use.'
