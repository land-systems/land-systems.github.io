abstract: Previous estimates of the land area available for future cropland expansion
  relied on global-scale climate, soil and terrain data. They did not include a range
  of constraints and tradeoffs associated with land conversion. As a result, estimates
  of the global land reserve have been high. Here we adjust these estimates for the
  aforementioned constraints and tradeoffs. We define potentially available cropland
  as the moderately to highly productive land that could be used in the coming years
  for rainfed farming, with low to moderate capital investments, and that is not under
  intact mature forests, legally protected, or already intensively managed. This productive
  land is underutilized rather than unused as it has ecological or social functions.
  We also define potentially available cropland that accounts for trade-offs between
  gains in agricultural production and losses in ecosystem and social services from
  intensified agriculture, to include only the potentially available cropland that
  would entail low ecological and social costs with conversion to cropland. In contrast
  to previous studies, we adopt a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach by analyzing detailed,
  fine scale observations with expert knowledge for six countries or regions that
  are often assumed to include most of potentially available cropland. We conclude
  first that there is substantially less potential additional cropland than is generally
  assumed once constraints and trade offs are taken into account, and secondly that
  converting land is always associated with significant social and ecological costs.
  Future expansion of agricultural production will encounter a complex landscape of
  competing demands and tradeoffs. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
