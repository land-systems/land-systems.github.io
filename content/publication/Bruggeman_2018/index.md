abstract: Bhutan is characterized by a landscape dominated by forests. A substantial
  share of these forests is dedicated to nature conservation, with an extensive protected
  area network connected by biological corridors. Forestlands are also partly allocated
  to timber production, including forest management units subjected to strict regulations.
  We assessed the effectiveness of these various land-use zoning units to protect
  forest cover. We used a matching procedure to control for covariates and obtain
  robust estimates of the impact of each type of unit on forest cover changes during
  the 2000s. We also investigated subsets of the protected area network to test for
  effectiveness heterogeneities within this network. Our results showed that protected
  areas prevented 63% of the forest loss expected in forestlands under this protection
  status. These units also curtailed forest gain. Long-established protected areas
  were more effective at avoiding forest loss than recent ones, while the levels of
  stringency and operationality of protected areas had no differentiable impact on
  forest loss. We detected more forest loss in forests surrounding protected areas
  compared to more distant forestlands, showing a leakage effect. Biological corridors
  had no impact on forest loss and gain. Forest management units decreased forest
  loss by half. After accounting for the selection bias, this study demonstrated the
  effectiveness of land use zoning for forest conservation in Bhutan.
