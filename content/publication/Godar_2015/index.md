abstract: The consumption of internationally traded goods causes multiple socio-environmental
  impacts. Current methods linking production impacts to final consumption typically
  trace the origin of products back to the country level, lacking fine-scale spatial
  resolution. This hampers accurate calculation of trade and consumption footprints,
  masking and distorting the causal links between consumers&#x27; choices and their
  environmental impacts, especially in countries with large spatial variability in
  socio-environmental conditions and production impacts. Here we present the SEI-PCS
  model (Spatially Explicit Information on Production to Consumption Systems), which
  allows for fine-scale sub-national assessments of the origin of, and socio-environmental
  impacts embedded in, traded commodities. The method connects detailed production
  data at sub-national scales (e.g., municipalities or provinces), information on
  domestic flows of goods and in international trade. The model permits the downscaling
  of country-to-country trade analyses based on either physical allocation from bilateral
  trade matrices or MRIO models. The importance of producing more spatially-explicit
  trade analyses is illustrated by identifying the municipalities of Brazil from which
  different countries source the Brazilian soy they consume. Applications for improving
  consumption accounting and policy assessment are discussed, including quantification
  of externalities of consumption, consumer labeling, trade leakages, sustainable
  resource supply and traceability.
