abstract: Since the early 1970s, the agricultural frontier of southeastern Amazon
  has undergone extensive land use changes. These alterations, combined with regional
  climate changes, have the potential to influence the hydrologic cycle at small to
  large scales. We evaluated a 40-year time series (1976 to 2015) of rainfall and
  water yield and related them to land use changes in the Upper Xingu River Basin
  (UX). We acquired data from six rainfall stations and four river gauges and mapped
  land use changes. Mann-Kendall trend analysis and Pettitt’s change point detection
  were employed to describe annual and seasonal changes in the time series. Monthly
  water yield from the Xingu River was used to derive annual, seasonal, and monthly
  water yield, as well as the runoff coefficient. The largest changes in land use
  occurred during the last two decades and approximately 60,900 km2 in the Upper Xingu
  Basin were deforested between 1985 and 2015. Rainfall in the Xingu Basin decreased
  by about 245 mm over the period but there was no trend in water yield. The number
  of rainy days and intensity of events also decreased, but the length of the rainy
  season and seasonal and annual water yield did not change. Although watershed deforestation
  has increased water yield in other Amazon rivers, the reduction in rainfall in the
  Upper Xingu Basin was high enough to mask this effect.
