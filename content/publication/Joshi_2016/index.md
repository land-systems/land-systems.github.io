abstract: The wealth of complementary data available from remote sensing missions
  can hugely aid efforts towards accurately determining land use and quantifying subtle
  changes in land use management or intensity. This study reviewed 112 studies on
  fusing optical and radar data, which offer unique spectral and structural information,
  for land cover and use assessments. Contrary to our expectations, only 50 studies
  specifically addressed land use, and five assessed land use changes, while the majority
  addressed land cover. The advantages of fusion for land use analysis were assessed
  in 32 studies, and a large majority (28 studies) concluded that fusion improved
  results compared to using single data sources. Study sites were small, frequently
  300–3000 km 2 or individual plots, with a lack of comparison of results and accuracies
  across sites. Although a variety of fusion techniques were used, pre-classification
  fusion followed by pixel-level inputs in traditional classification algorithms (e.g.,
  Gaussian maximum likelihood classification) was common, but often without a concrete
  rationale on the applicability of the method to the land use theme being studied.
  Progress in this field of research requires the development of robust techniques
  of fusion to map the intricacies of land uses and changes therein and systematic
  procedures to assess the benefits of fusion over larger spatial scales.
