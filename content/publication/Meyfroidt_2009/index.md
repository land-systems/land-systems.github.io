abstract: In some countries across the globe, tropical forest cover is increasing.
  The national-scale reforestation of Vietnam since 1992 is assumed to contribute
  to this recovery. It is achieved, however, by the displacement of forest extraction
  to other countries on the order of 49 (34-70) M m(3), or approximately 39% of the
  regrowth of Vietnam&#x27;s forests from 1987 to 2006. Approximately half of wood
  imports to Vietnam during this period were illegal. Leakage due to policies restricting
  forest exploitation and displacement due to growing domestic consumption and exports
  contributed respectively to an estimated 58% and 42% of total displacement. Exports
  of wood products from Vietnam also grew rapidly, amounting to 84% of the displacement,
  which is a remarkable feature of the forest transition in Vietnam. Attribution of
  the displacement and corresponding forest extraction to Vietnam, the source countries
  or the final consumers is thus debatable. Sixty-one percent of the regrowth in Vietnam
  was, thus, not associated with displacement abroad. Policies allocating credits
  to countries for reducing deforestation and forest degradation should monitor illegal
  timber trade and take into account the policy-induced leakage of wood extraction
  to other countries.
