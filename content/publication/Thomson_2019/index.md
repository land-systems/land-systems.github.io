abstract: Sustainable intensification of agricultural production is expected to be
  an important pathway for achieving future food security while protecting the environment.
  Recognizing that there is no single answer to how different dimensions of intensification
  can be achieved sustainably, we identify opportunities for research across spatial
  scales. We focus specifically on research questions around advances in technology
  and management and suggest that progress on these questions can be made by (i) improving
  understanding of trade-offs, especially across scales, (ii) recognition of the context-specificity
  of how agricultural intensification can become more sustainable, and (iii) development,
  access and wider use of global datasets for integrative research.
