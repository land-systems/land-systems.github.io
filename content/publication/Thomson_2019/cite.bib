    abstract = "Sustainable intensification of agricultural production is expected to be an important pathway for achieving future food security while protecting the environment. Recognizing that there is no single answer to how different dimensions of intensification can be achieved sustainably, we identify opportunities for research across spatial scales. We focus specifically on research questions around advances in technology and management and suggest that progress on these questions can be made by (i) improving understanding of trade-offs, especially across scales, (ii) recognition of the context-specificity of how agricultural intensification can become more sustainable, and (iii) development, access and wider use of global datasets for integrative research.",
