abstract: 'In the light of daunting global sustainability challenges such as climate
  change, biodiversity loss and food security, improving our understanding of the
  complex dynamics of the Earth system is crucial. However, large knowledge gaps related
  to the effects of land management persist, in particular those human-induced changes
  in terrestrial ecosystems that do not result in land-cover conversions. Here, we
  review the current state of knowledge of ten common land management activities for
  their biogeochemical and biophysical impacts, the level of process understanding
  and data availability. Our review shows that ca. one-tenth of the ice-free land
  surface is under intense human management, half under medium and one-fifth under
  extensive management. Based on our review, we cluster these ten management activities
  into three groups: (i) management activities for which data sets are available,
  and for which a good knowledge base exists (cropland harvest and irrigation); (ii)
  management activities for which sufficient knowledge on biogeochemical and biophysical
  effects exists but robust global data sets are lacking (forest harvest, tree species
  selection, grazing and mowing harvest, N fertilization); and (iii) land management
  practices with severe data gaps concomitant with an unsatisfactory level of process
  understanding (crop species selection, artificial wetland drainage, tillage and
  fire management and crop residue management, an element of crop harvest). Although
  we identify multiple impediments to progress, we conclude that the current status
  of process understanding and data availability is sufficient to advance with incorporating
  management in, for example, Earth system or dynamic vegetation models in order to
  provide a systematic assessment of their role in the Earth system. This review contributes
  to a strategic prioritization of research efforts across multiple disciplines, including
  land system research, ecological research and Earth system modelling.'
