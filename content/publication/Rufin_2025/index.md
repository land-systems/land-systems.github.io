abstract: 'As a group of scientists concerned with the sustainability of smallholder agriculture, we call for coordinated efforts to facilitate access to commercial EO image archives containing spatially comprehensive and repeated satellite image acquisitions at very high spatial resolution over low- and middle-income countries hosting most smallholder regions. This would greatly accelerate SDG monitoring and research, enabling progress toward reaching SDG 2 and ultimately mitigating hunger in smallholder-dominated systems.'
