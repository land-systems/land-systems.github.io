abstract: 'The use of agent-based modelling approaches in ex-post and ex-ante evaluations
  of agricultural policies has been progressively increasing over the last few years.
  There are now a sufficient number of models that it is worth taking stock of the
  way these models have been developed. Here, we review 20 agricultural agent-based
  models (ABM) addressing heterogeneous decision-making processes in the context of
  European agriculture. The goals of this review were to i) develop a framework describing
  aspects of farmers&#x27; decision-making that are relevant from a farm-systems perspective,
  ii) reveal the current state-of-the-art in representing farmers&#x27; decision-making
  in the European agricultural sector, and iii) provide a critical reflection of underdeveloped
  research areas and on future opportunities in modelling decision-making. To compare
  different approaches in modelling farmers&#x27; behaviour, we focused on the European
  agricultural sector, which presents a specific character with its family farms,
  its single market and the common agricultural policy (CAP). We identified several
  key properties of farmers&#x27; decision-making: the multi-output nature of production;
  the importance of non-agricultural activities; heterogeneous household and family
  characteristics; and the need for concurrent short- and long-term decision-making.
  These properties were then used to define levels and types of decision-making mechanisms
  to structure a literature review. We find most models are sophisticated in the representation
  of farm exit and entry decisions, as well as the representation of long-term decisions
  and the consideration of farming styles or types using farm typologies. Considerably
  fewer attempts to model farmers&#x27; emotions, values, learning, risk and uncertainty
  or social interactions occur in the different case studies. We conclude that there
  is considerable scope to improve diversity in representation of decision-making
  and the integration of social interactions in agricultural agent-based modelling
  approaches by combining existing modelling approaches and promoting model inter-comparisons.
  Thus, this review provides a valuable entry point for agent-based modellers, agricultural
  systems modellers and data driven social scientists for the re-use and sharing of
  model components, code and data. An intensified dialogue could fertilize more coordinated
  and purposeful combinations and comparisons of ABM and other modelling approaches
  as well as better reconciliation of empirical data and theoretical foundations,
  which ultimately are key to developing improved models of agricultural systems.'
