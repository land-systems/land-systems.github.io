abstract: Land systems are the result of human interactions with the natural environment.
  Understanding the drivers, state, trends and impacts of different land systems on
  social and natural processes helps to reveal how changes in the land system affect
  the functioning of the socio-ecological system as a whole and the tradeoff these
  changes may represent. The Global Land Project has led advances by synthesizing
  land systems research across different scales and providing concepts to further
  understand the feedbacks between social-and environmental systems, between urban
  and rural environments and between distant world regions. Land system science has
  moved from a focus on observation of change and understanding the drivers of these
  changes to a focus on using this understanding to design sustainable transformations
  through stakeholder engagement and through the concept of land governance. As land
  use can be seen as the largest geo-engineering project in which mankind has engaged,
  land system science can act as a platform for integration of insights from different
  disciplines and for translation of knowledge into action.
