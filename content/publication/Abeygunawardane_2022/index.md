abstract: Actor-level data on large-scale commercial agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa
  are scarce. The peculiar choice of transnational investing in African land has,
  therefore, been subject to conjecture. Addressing this gap, we reconstructed the
  underlying logics of investment location choices in a Bayesian network, using firm-
  and actor-level interview and spatial data from 37 transnational agriculture and
  forestry investments across 121 sites in Mozambique, Zambia, Tanzania, and Ethiopia.
  We distinguish four investment locations across gradients of resource frontiers
  and agglomeration economies to derive the preferred locations of different investors
  with varied skillsets and market reach (i.e., track record). In contrast to newcomers,
  investors with extensive track records are more likely to expand the land use frontier,
  but they are also likely to survive the high transaction costs of the pre-commercial
  frontier. We highlight key comparative advantages of Southern and Eastern African
  frontiers and map the most probable categories of investment locations.
