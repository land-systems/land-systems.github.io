abstract: To date, assessments of the sustainability of agricultural commodity supply
  chains have largely relied on some combination of macro-scale footprint accounts,
  detailed life-cycle analyses and fine-scale traceability systems. Yet these approaches
  are limited in their ability to support the sustainability governance of agricultural
  supply chains, whether because they are intended for coarser-grained analyses, do
  not identify individual actors, or are too costly to be implemented in a consistent
  manner for an entire region of production. Here we illustrate some of the advantages
  of a complementary middle-ground approach that balances detail and scale of supply
  chain transparency information by combining consistent country-wide data on commodity
  production at the sub-national (e.g. municipal) level with per shipment customs
  data to describe trade flows of a given commodity covering all companies and production
  regions within that country. This approach can support supply chain governance in
  two key ways. First, enhanced spatial resolution of the production regions that
  connect to individual supply chains allows for a more accurate consideration of
  geographic variability in measures of risk and performance that are associated with
  different production practices. Second, identification of key actors that operate
  within a specific supply chain, including producers, traders, shippers and consumers
  can help discriminate coalitions of actors that have shared stake in a particular
  region, and that together are capable of delivering more cost-effective and coordinated
  interventions. We illustrate the potential of this approach with examples from Brazil,
  Indonesia and Colombia. We discuss how transparency information can deepen understanding
  of the environmental and social impacts of commodity production systems, how benefits
  are distributed among actors, and some of the trade-offs involved in efforts to
  improve supply chain sustainability. We then discuss the challenges and opportunities
  of our approach to strengthen supply chain governance and leverage more effective
  and fair accountability systems.
