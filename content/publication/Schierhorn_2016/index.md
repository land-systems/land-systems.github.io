abstract: Changes in the production or consumption of agricultural commodities in
  one place can drastically affect land use and the environment elsewhere. We show
  how changes in beef production and consumption in Russia following the breakdown
  of the Soviet Union in 1991 contributed to the emergence of a beef trade linkage
  between Brazil and Russia. We argue that the decline of Russian beef production
  after 1991, the rebound of domestic consumption since the late 1990s, the global
  beef trade constellation of the early 2000s, and the booming Brazilian cattle sector
  during the same periods forged a strong and lasting telecoupling in the beef trade
  between Brazil and Russia. As a result, Russia became the largest importer of both
  CO 2 and non-CO 2 emissions embodied in Brazilian beef exports since the 2000s.
  Our review exemplifies how the combination of institutional and socioeconomic shocks
  along with major changes in global markets can couple food systems and redistribute
  environmental footprints across long distances. Incorporating telecouplings in assessments
  of sustainable food systems is therefore important.
