abstract: Forest, in particular deciduous forest, is a key element in determining
  areas with a high probability of tick presence. The way forest is generally monitored
  may be ill suited to some landscapes where Ixodes ricinus is found, as forest is
  usually characterised using crisp land cover classes. However, tree vegetation can
  be found outside of forests and continuous gradations of tree density can be found
  in a variety of landscapes. In this paper we investigate the probability of tick
  presence in southern Norway using landscape description based both on land cover
  classes and continuous data describing the tree cover fraction. Both perspectives
  on the landscape are significant in the logistic model, indicating that the usual
  approach based solely on land cover classes may not be comprehensive enough in capturing
  tick habitat, and characterising the landscape with variables focused on single
  specific elements may be insufficient.
