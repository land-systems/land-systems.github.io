abstract: Land use science has traditionally used case-study approaches for in-depth
  investigation of land use change processes and impacts. Meta-studies synthesize
  findings across case-study evidence to identify general patterns. In this paper,
  we provide a review of meta-studies in land use science. Various meta-studies have
  been conducted, which synthesize deforestation and agricultural land use change
  processes, while other important changes, such as urbanization, wetland conversion,
  and grassland dynamics have hardly been addressed. Meta-studies of land use change
  impacts focus mostly on biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles, while meta-studies
  of socioeconomic consequences are rare. Land use change processes and land use change
  impacts are generally addressed in isolation, while only few studies considered
  trajectories of drivers through changes to their impacts and their potential feedbacks.
  We provide a conceptual framework for linking meta-studies of land use change processes
  and impacts for the analysis of coupled human–environmental systems. Moreover, we
  provide suggestions for combining meta-studies of different land use change processes
  to develop a more integrated theory of land use change, and for combining meta-studies
  of land use change impacts to identify tradeoffs between different impacts. Land
  use science can benefit from an improved conceptualization of land use change processes
  and their impacts, and from new methods that combine meta-study findings to advance
  our understanding of human–environmental systems.
