abstract: 'Interactions between land systems and food systems are central in land
  system science. Here, we highlight three interrelated emerging directions for renewing
  this research agenda: 1) What is the role of input providers, and in particular
  external advisors, financial institutions, and investment modes in shaping farm
  management decisions? 2) Beyond the overall land footprint of distinct production
  modes and diets, what are the impacts of emerging, rapidly shifting, diet trends?
  and 3) How to grapple with the trade-offs between labor as a substitutable input
  versus labor as a source of livelihood, and in particular, what is the labor productivity
  and drudgery of alternative forms of agriculture such as organic farming and agroecology,
  and how does this balance with the rate of off-farm labor force absorption.'
