abstract: Land-use frontiers, such as agriculture expanding into forests, remain a
  major driver of biodiversity loss, and often lead to conservation responses. To
  better understand the geographies of conservation, connecting conservation with
  tools used widely in Land System Science – particularly the frontier concept – allows
  assessing the patterns, actors, and drivers of conservation. We propose that land
  conservation can be analysed through three different perspectives. First, conservation
  can be framed as efforts to slow or stop other frontiers. Second, the expansion
  of conservation could itself be described as a frontier process, similarly leading
  to institutional and cultural reorganization, and sometimes conflicts (e.g. green
  grabbing). Third, frontiers can be seen as spaces where multiple land uses, including
  conservation, interact. Analysing conservation through these perspectives could
  be particularly powerful to thoroughly consider the social-ecological contexts in
  which conservation happens, and thus to bridge the disciplines of Land System Science
  and Conservation Science.
