abstract: 'The Amazon Forest is an unquestionable cradle of planetary biological diversity
  and plays a fundamental role in regional and global climate change regulation. Annual
  deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon have gone up since 2012, presenting
  a grim scenario for 2021. The majority of this deforestation is illegal, but a significant
  proportion, 11.3 million hectares of forest in privately owned land, can be legally
  deforested and impact local climate, compromising Brazil’s Nationally Determined
  Contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement. Thus, a fundamental question remains:
  how can we avoid potentially legal deforestation? Farmers and ranchers who have
  the right to deforest have long demanded financial incentives to keep their forests
  standing, but few (if any) mechanisms exist to achieve it. We developed a compensation
  mechanism called CONSERV, hypothesizing that legal deforestation can be avoided
  through targeted compensation. CONSERV can potentially contribute to climate change
  mitigation and foster business models geared towards conservation and increased
  agricultural productivity when implemented at scale. We present CONSERV’s concept
  and potential to become an operational mechanism for Payment for Ecosystem Services/REDD
  + in line with Brazil’s Native Vegetation Protection Law and NDC commitment. Furthermore,
  we introduce some ideas on how CONSERV ensures permanence and minimizes leakage
  while gaining scale. To successfully maintain climatic stability and ecosystems,
  we need to reduce deforestation, both illegal and legal. CONSERV can help us solve
  the latter.'
