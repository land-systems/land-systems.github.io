abstract: The early studies of the ASB Partnership for the Tropical Forest Margins
  stratified the domain for study into stages of a generic transition pathway that
  suggested a strongly non-linear trajectory of change. In this scheme, a phase of
  degradation of aboveground vegetation, based on over-logging or shortening fallow
  cycles in intensified swiddens can lead to a grass-fire cycle that needs special
  conditions to allow successful rehabilitation. Many places with current agroforestry
  and tree mosaics have gone through such a phase. A new review of the global literature
  on these ‘forest transitions’ by Meyfroidt and Lambin (2011) framed important conclusions.
