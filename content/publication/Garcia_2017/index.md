abstract: In the Amazon-savanna ecotone in northwest Brazil, the understudied Araguaia
  River Basin contains high biodiversity and seasonal wetlands. The region is representative
  of tropical humid-dry ecotone zones, which have experienced intense land use and
  land cover (LULC) conversions. Here we assessed the LULC changes for the last four
  decades in the central portion of the Araguaia River Basin to understand the temporal
  changes in the landscape composition and configuration outside and inside protected
  areas. We conducted these analyzes by LULC mapping and landscape metrics based on
  patch classes. During this period, native vegetation was reduced by 26%. Forests
  were the most threatened physiognomy, with significant areal reduction and fragmentation.
  Native vegetation cover was mainly replaced by croplands and pastures. Such replacement
  followed spatial and temporal trends related to the implementation of protected
  areas and increases in population cattle herds. The creation of most protected areas
  took place between 1996 and 2007, the same period during which the conversion of
  the landscape matrix from natural vegetation to agriculture occurred. We observed
  that protected areas mitigate fragmentation, but their roles differ according to
  their location and level of protection. Still, we argue that landscape characteristics,
  such as suitability for agriculture, also influence landscape conversions and should
  be considered when establishing protected areas. The information provided in this
  study can guide new research on species conservation and landscape planning, as
  well as improve the understanding of the impacts of landscape composition and configuration
  changes.
