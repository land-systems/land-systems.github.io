abstract: A key lever to mitigate global climate change is the reversal of forest
  carbon emissions trends throughout the Global South. Reduced Emissions from Deforestation
  and Forest Degradation (REDD+) initiatives seek to conserve forest carbon stocks
  primarily through national and sub-national policies and interventions. Dominant
  drivers of forest change are, however, increasingly international in scope, tied
  to global commodity markets and investment flows, and are not easily captured or
  effectively addressed through nation-based carbon accounting. The fragmentary adoption
  of REDD+ across forest nations leaves room for the displacement of deforestation
  from early-adopters and countries with more rigorous carbon-related regulatory regimes
  to late-adopters of REDD+. While this displacement is expected to be substantial,
  our empirical understanding of the causal pathways of transboundary displacement
  remains weak. Our research addresses this lacuna, focusing on Vietnam, an early
  adopter of REDD+ that has experienced significant reforestation despite exponential
  growth in exports of key forest-risk commodities, sourced in large part from Lao
  PDR and Cambodia. We show that over the last decade, the trade of forest-risk commodities
  was large and accelerating in the Mekong region, concurrent with the rapid expansion
  of large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs), constituting important, inter-related
  causal pathways for the displacement of deforestation and forest degradation. LSLAs
  are, however, core of national economic development strategies in the Mekong region,
  indicating a problematic relationship between REDD+, trade flows and land and forest
  governance. We explore the problematic intersection between these dynamic processes,
  their impacts on forests in Lao PDR and Cambodia, and implications for global efforts
  to manage forest resources and reduce emissions. The inability of REDD+ to address
  transboundary impacts suggests the need for complementary interventions that address
  supply- and demand-side dynamics.
