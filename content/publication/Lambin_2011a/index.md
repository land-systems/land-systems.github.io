abstract: A central challenge for sustainability is how to preserve forest ecosystems
  and the services that they provide us while enhancing food production. This challenge
  for developing countries confronts the force of economic globalization, which seeks
  cropland that is shrinking in availability and triggers deforestation. Four mechanisms—the
  displacement, rebound, cascade, and remittance effects—that are amplified by economic
  globalization accelerate land conversion. A few developing countries have managed
  a land use transition over the recent decades that simultaneously increased their
  forest cover and agricultural production. These countries have relied on various
  mixes of agricultural intensification, land use zoning, forest protection, increased
  reliance on imported food and wood products, the creation of off-farm jobs, foreign
  capital investments, and remittances. Sound policies and innovations can therefore
  reconcile forest preservation with food production. Globalization can be harnessed
  to increase land use efficiency rather than leading to uncontrolled land use expansion.
  To do so, land systems should be understood and modeled as open systems with large
  flows of goods, people, and capital that connect local land use with global-scale
  factors.
