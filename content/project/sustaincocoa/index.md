title: SUSTAIN-COCOA

event: SUSTAIN-COCOA

summary: Sustainable sourcing policies in the cocoa sector
abstract: 'In the proposed research we aim to investigate the conditions under which supply chain sustainability initiatives (SSIs) can lead to reduced deforestation and increased shade-​tree cover in cocoa production systems and, in turn, a triple-​win of increased biodiversity, climate change mitigation, and livelihood resilience.
Our cross-​scale, interdisciplinary, and transnational approach will provide insights into the on-​the-ground impacts of existing SSIs in the cocoa sector and the potential impacts of scaling up SSIs to reduce deforestation and enhance shade-​tree cover. Furthermore, it will clarify the role that agroforestry can play in helping deliver multiple sustainability objectives: protecting biodiversity, climate mitigation, and improved farmer livelihoods. It thus aligns well with the EU’s efforts to step up action to protect and restore the world’s forests.'
