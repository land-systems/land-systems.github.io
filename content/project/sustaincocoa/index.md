title: SUSTAIN-COCOA

event: SUSTAIN-COCOA

summary: Sustainable sourcing policies in the cocoa sector
abstract: 'In the proposed research we aim to investigate the conditions under which supply chain sustainability initiatives (SSIs) can lead to reduced deforestation and increased shade-​tree cover in cocoa production systems and, in turn, a triple-​win of increased biodiversity, climate change mitigation, and livelihood resilience.
Our cross-​scale, interdisciplinary, and transnational approach will provide insights into the on-​the-ground impacts of existing SSIs in the cocoa sector and the potential impacts of scaling up SSIs to reduce deforestation and enhance shade-​tree cover. Furthermore, it will clarify the role that agroforestry can play in helping deliver multiple sustainability objectives: protecting biodiversity, climate mitigation, and improved farmer livelihoods. It thus aligns well with the EU’s efforts to step up action to protect and restore the world’s forests.'

In the proposed research, funded by [Biodiversa](https://www.biodiversa.eu/2022/10/26/sustain-cocoa/) we aim to investigate the conditions under which supply chain sustainability initiatives (SSIs) can lead to reduced deforestation and increased shade-​tree cover in cocoa production systems and, in turn, a triple-​win of increased biodiversity, climate change mitigation, and livelihood resilience.
Our cross-​scale, interdisciplinary, and transnational approach will provide insights into the on-​the-ground impacts of existing SSIs in the cocoa sector and the potential impacts of scaling up SSIs to reduce deforestation and enhance shade-​tree cover. Furthermore, it will clarify the role that agroforestry can play in helping deliver multiple sustainability objectives: protecting biodiversity, climate mitigation, and improved farmer livelihoods. It thus aligns well with the EU’s efforts to step up action to protect and restore the world’s forests.
